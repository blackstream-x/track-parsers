# track-parsers
Scripts printing tracklist information for use in MusicBrainzâ€™ track parser.

This repository has been inspired by [Jason's perl-based MusicBrainz Track Parsers](https://github.com/VxJasonxV/MusicBrainz-Track-Parsers).
I wanted to create something similar using python, with Nautilus integration.
